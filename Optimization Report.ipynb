I was unable to get over 72% and was therefore unable to meet the perfomance goal. I attempted the model with different variations of layers (from 1-3) with epochs between 100-200 and with different types of neurons. Overall, my most successful model was the single layered \"relu\" model."

I think my next effort would be attempting to remove additional columns from the dataset in order to narrow down the model's focus. I think that with this particular dataset one (maybe two) layers are sufficient and any more would lead to overfitting the dataset. I would also play a bit more with the types of layers in order to see which would best fit this particular model. "
